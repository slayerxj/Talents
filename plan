    textarea should be two columns, one is the time stamp, the other one is content.
    The time stamp should be sticky, and the content will be auto strech height.
    The edited textarea should not be modified default, but provide two buttons: edit / delete
    And there is a blank textarea can be edited any time, lose focus to add or "add" to add?
